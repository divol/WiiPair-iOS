Quick iOS app to pair a Wii Remote with BTstack.

After pairing you can press any button on the WiiMote and it will seek out a
connection with the iOS device.

The BTstack flow for accepting such a connection is:
--> Register L2CAP services for PSM_HID_INTERRUPT and PSM_HID_CONTROL

<-- HCI_EVENT_CONNECTION_COMPLETE
--> hci_switch_role_command (Switch to master)
--- The hci_switch_role_command here is imperative, without it
    the WiiMote will disconnect almost immediately.

--- For both the INTERRUPT and CONTROL channels
<-- L2CAP_EVENT_INCOMING_CONNECTION
--> l2cap_accept_connection
<-- L2CAP_EVENT_CHANNEL_OPENED
--- Connection is now established.

This exact flow of events can be used to establish connections to
SixAxis and DualShock 3 pads as well.

By allowing the removal of Bluetooth inquiry code, and reuse between PS3 pads,
using pairing can greatly simplify BTstack related input code.
