Quick iOS app to pair a Wii Remote or DualShock 4 with BTstack.

After pairing you can turn the controller on normally and it will seek out a
connection with the iOS device.

The BTstack flow for accepting such a connection is:
--> Register L2CAP services for PSM_HID_INTERRUPT and PSM_HID_CONTROL

<-- HCI_EVENT_CONNECTION_COMPLETE
--> hci_switch_role_command (Switch to master)
--- The hci_switch_role_command here is imperative, without it
    the WiiMote will disconnect almost immediately.

--- For both the INTERRUPT and CONTROL channels
<-- L2CAP_EVENT_INCOMING_CONNECTION
--> l2cap_accept_connection
<-- L2CAP_EVENT_CHANNEL_OPENED
--- Connection is now established.

This exact flow of events can be used to establish connections to
a Wii Remote, DualShock 3 and DualShock 4.

By allowing the removal of Bluetooth inquiry code, and reuse between pad types,
using pairing can greatly simplify BTstack related gamepad code.

WiiMote Pairing Procedure:
--> hci_create_connection
<-- HCI_EVENT_CONNECTION_COMPLETE
--> hci_authentication_requested
<-- HCI_EVENT_PIN_CODE_REQUEST
--> hci_pin_code_request_reply
<-- HCI_AUTHENTICATION_COMPLETE
--> l2cap_open_channel (Control and Interrupt)
<-- L2CAP_CHANNEL_OPENED (Both channels)
--- Pairing Complete

DualShock 4 Pairing Procedure:
--> hci_set_event_mask (Enable all)
<-- HCI_COMMAND_COMPLETE
--> hci_write_simple_pairing_mode (Enable)
<-- HCI_COMMAND_COMPLETE
--> hci_create_connection
<-- HCI_CONNECTION_COMPLETE
--> l2cap_open_channel (Control)
<-- L2CAP_CHANNEL_OPENED (Control)
--- Pairing Complete
--- This procedure is wrong is some way; in the end the DualShock 4
    will be paired but the controller will disconnect after the
    first L2CAP channel is opened.
